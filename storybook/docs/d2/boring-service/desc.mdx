# Queries



---

**sleep** ( duration: `Long` ) : `Boolean` <br/> 

So boring, can't help but sleep

 

---

**procrastinate** ( query: `String` ) <br/> 

Doesn't even bother to do anything

 

---

**consume** ( query: `Long` ) <br/> 

Would consume stuff if it weren't lazy

 

---

**doStuff** ( query: [`BoringInterface`](/docs/sample-boring-documentation--page#boring-object) ) : `Boolean` <br/> 

Probably does stuff but it's not really interesting

 

---

**supply** ( ) : `Boolean` <br/> 

Supplies a useless not-ever-changing indicator

 

---

**getBoring** ( query: [`BoringGetQuery`](/docs/sample-boring-documentation--page#boring-get-query) ) : [`BoringGetQueryResult`](/docs/sample-boring-documentation--page#boring-get-query) <br/> 

Annoying function
